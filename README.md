# PCM - A yum like wrapper for pacman

A simple shell command wrapper to create a yum like command, `pcm`, for those
used to using yum and moving to arch. Or for those who would prefer a less
cryptic command syntax for common pacman and pkgfile commands.

## Install

I don't have a formal installer. I recommend cloning the repo somewhere you can
keep it around. I use a directory called `pkgs` in my $HOME. Then link the `pcm`
command into your `~/bin/`. For example:

    > cd
    > mkdir -p pkgs
    > cd pkgs
    > git clone https://github.com/jeffbuttars/pcm.git pcm
    > cd
    > mkdir -p ~/bin
    > ln -s $HOME/pkgs/pcm/pcm $HOME/bin/

Then, make sure that `$HOME/bin` is in your path. A line like the following in
your `$HOME/.bashrc` should do it:

    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"


## Commands

The command syntax is simply:

    > pcm <command> <args>

### install

Install a package or list of packages.

    > pcm install pkg1 pkg2 ...


### remove, uninstall

remove/uninstall a package or list of packages

    > pcm remove pkg1 pkg2 ...
    > pcm uninstall pkg1 pkg2 ...


### provides

Find packages that contain a file matching a regex.

    > pcm provides '*/headerfile.c'


### update

Update all installed packages or update specified packages..  

Update the system:

    > pcm update

Update kde:

    > pcm update kde

### sync, makecache

Update the package and pkginfo local databases

    > pcm sync
    > pcm makecache


### info

Get information about a package or packge group

    > pcm info pkgname
    > pcm info pkggroup


### Fall through

If you you give pcm a command that is not specific to pcm, then pcm will pass
that command and all arguments straight to pacman. In this case, pcm behaves
much like an alias to pacman.

For instance:

    > pcm -Su

is equivelant to

    > pacman -Su
